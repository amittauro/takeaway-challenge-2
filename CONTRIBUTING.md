#### Opening a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)

Remember to open your pull request before Code Review, but you don't need to wait until you've finished to open it! You can continue to push code and the Pull Request will automatically update with the new work.

1. Push your work to your remote repository
2. Navigate to your repository on GitHub and click on the `Pull Requests` tab next to `Code`.
3. Click on `New Pull Request`
4. Add a description and Create!
5. Continue to push work
